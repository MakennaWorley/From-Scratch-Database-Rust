# From Scratch Database
A side project to help me improve in rust and better learn databases

Just another side project I spun up to learn more about rust and become a better
rust programmer. I also want to learn more about how databases work and thus why not
code one to make sure I really do understand it.

To run:

Make sure you have Rust installed on your device (https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/ch01-01-installation.html)

Pull down the lastest changes from the main branch.

Run ```cargo build``` and then run from that same location ```cargo run```.
